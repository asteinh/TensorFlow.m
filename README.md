## About
`tensorflow.m` is a package of MATLAB/Octave bindings for the [C API](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) of TensorFlow. The interface uses a MEX function and wrapper classes to expose the TensorFlow core functionality in MATLAB/Octave.
Whenever possible, the development of these bindings tries to obey [the approach recommended](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/guide/extend/bindings.md) by TensorFlow.

## Contributions
